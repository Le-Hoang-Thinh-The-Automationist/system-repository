# 🔹 Technology Stack (Spring Boot + Cost-Optimized FSI)

* **Backend Framework:** Spring Boot 3.x

  * `spring-boot-starter-web`
  * `spring-kafka` (preferred for FSI, but Redis Streams works as MVP)
  * `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`
  * `resilience4j-spring-boot3` (circuit breaker, retry)

* **Event Broker Options:**

  * **Kafka** (FSI industry standard, strong ordering/durability, free in local env via Docker)
  * **Redis Streams** (lightweight, easier for MVP)

* **Event Patterns:**

  * **Outbox Pattern** → ensure reliable event publishing from services (transactional write + event log)
  * **CQRS** → separate read/write stores (transactions vs analytics views)
  * **Saga Orchestration** → Spring State Machine or custom orchestrator
  * **Dead Letter Queue** → Kafka DLQ topic / Redis failed-stream

* **Compliance & Security:**

  * Event immutability → append-only event store
  * Event signing → SHA-256 or RSA signature on payloads
  * Audit log → `event_audit_log` table in Postgres
  * Retention → 7+ years (FSI requirement)

* **Monitoring & Metrics:**

  * Spring Actuator + Micrometer → Prometheus/Grafana
  * Track throughput, lag, failure counts

# 🚀 MVP Scope (Spring Boot Event Hub)

1. **Event Publishing/Consumption** via Kafka (or Redis for beginner setup).
2. **Deduplication & Ordering** → use event IDs + partition key.
3. **Dead Letter Queue** → failed events redirected for reprocessing.
4. **Outbox Pattern** → services write to local DB, hub consumes and publishes reliably.
5. **Event Replay** → ability to replay events from a stored topic/stream.
6. **Audit Trail** → log all events processed with hashes.
7. **Event Types (MVP subset):**

   * `user.registered`
   * `transaction.created`
   * `balance.updated`
   * `alert.triggered`
   * `notification.sent`

# ⭐ Important Spring Boot–Specific Highlights

✅ **Kafka first-class support** via Spring Kafka (beginner-friendly, industry standard).
✅ **Redis Streams fallback** if Kafka setup is too heavy for MVP.
✅ **Resilience4j** for circuit breaker/retries → prevents failures cascading.
✅ **Event immutability** → events never modified, only appended.
✅ **Replay capability** → reprocess historical events for recovery/compliance.
✅ **Audit logging** → every event has hash, timestamp, producer, consumer.

---

# ✅ Acceptance Criteria (MVP, FSI-aligned)

### **Functional**

1. Services can publish events into the hub.
2. Events consumed and processed in order.
3. Deduplication ensures same event ID is not processed twice.
4. Dead Letter Queue stores failed events for inspection/retry.
5. Replay endpoint replays past events from a given offset/timestamp.
6. Audit logs exist for every published/consumed event.
7. Basic saga orchestration for transaction + notification flow.

### **Non-Functional**

1. Events cryptographically signed (SHA-256/RSA).
2. Event broker provides ordering guarantees (Kafka partitions or Redis streams).
3. Event retention policy: minimum 7 years.
4. Event store immutable (append-only).
5. Processing throughput ≥ 100 events/sec for MVP.
6. Monitoring exposes metrics (success/failure rates, lag).
7. Cost optimization: Kafka/Redis run via Docker Compose locally.

👉 For MVP developers, I’d recommend **Redis Streams** for simplicity, then upgrade to **Kafka** when scaling.

Would you like me to **draft a simple Spring Boot package structure for this Event Hub** (like `producer`, `consumer`, `orchestration`, `audit`), so a beginner dev can follow the implementation easily?
