# 🔹 Technology Stack (Spring Boot + FSI aligned)

* **Backend Framework:** Spring Boot 3.x

  * `spring-boot-starter-web`
  * `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`
  * `spring-boot-starter-security`
  * `spring-boot-starter-validation`

* **Analytics & Performance:**

  * Caching: Spring Cache (with in-memory cache or Redis if needed)
  * Async processing: `@Async` / Spring Batch for heavy computations
  * Scheduled tasks (`@Scheduled`) for monthly summary generation

* **Data Visualization APIs:**

  * Provide JSON endpoints → frontend charts/graphs can consume
  * Export PDF/Excel → use libraries:

    * PDF: `iTextPDF` (free for dev, paid for commercial) or `Apache PDFBox`
    * Excel: Apache POI

* **Data Integrity & Compliance:**

  * All calculated balances reconciled with last transaction
  * Historical preservation: never overwrite summaries, always version
  * Audit logs: each analytical computation stored

* **Security:**

  * Only user’s own data accessible (Spring Security with JWT)
  * Encrypt PII fields in reports

* **Cost optimization:**

  * PostgreSQL (with materialized views for efficiency)
  * Spring Boot async/caching to reduce infra need
  * Deploy via Docker to free-tier cloud

# 🚀 MVP Scope (Spring Boot Analytics Service)

1. **Account Balances**

   * Real-time balance calc (sum of transactions)
   * Available balance (exclude pending)
   * Historical balance snapshots

2. **Monthly Reporting**

   * Income vs Expenses summary
   * Category breakdown (pie chart data)
   * MoM comparison (via monthly\_summaries table)

3. **Trend Analysis**

   * Spending trends over 3/6/12 months
   * Simple cash flow projection (linear extrapolation)
   * Financial health score (basic rule-based: savings % vs expenses)

4. **Data Visualization APIs**

   * JSON APIs for charts/graphs (frontend friendly)
   * Export PDF/Excel (basic reporting)

5. **Compliance & Integrity**

   * Audit trail for all computed summaries
   * Reconciliation check: balance = sum(transactions)
   * 7-year retention of analytics snapshots

# ⭐ Important Spring Boot–Specific Highlights

✅ **Performance**: use pre-aggregated tables (`monthly_summaries`, `category_analytics`) to avoid slow queries.
✅ **Scalability**: heavy computations offloaded to async jobs or scheduled nightly tasks.
✅ **Compliance**: audit every calculation run with timestamps + hash for data integrity.
✅ **Reports**: start with JSON APIs → add PDF/Excel export as MVP extension.
✅ **Alerts**: simple threshold-based (if expense > budget, send notification).

# ✅ Acceptance Criteria (MVP, FSI-aligned)

### **Functional**

1. User can query current and historical balances (real-time + from snapshots).
2. Monthly summaries generated automatically (income, expense, net cash flow).
3. Category breakdown (system + user-defined categories).
4. Spending trend APIs return 3/6/12-month data.
5. Cash flow projections and financial health score available.
6. Data export works (PDF & Excel for at least monthly reports).
7. Alerts can be configured (e.g., expense > threshold).

### **Non-Functional**

1. Balances reconcile correctly with transactions (integrity check).
2. Historical analytics preserved (no overwrites).
3. All computations logged in audit table with hash for integrity.
4. API responses < 1s for normal queries.
5. Heavy analytics run asynchronously, not blocking user requests.
6. Compliance: data retention 7+ years, export for regulators.
7. Cost-optimized: Postgres handles aggregation, caching improves performance.

👉 Do you want me to **combine these 3 services (Identity, Transaction, Analytics)** into a **unified architecture diagram (microservices with Spring Boot)** so you can see how they interconnect, or keep them as standalone designs?
