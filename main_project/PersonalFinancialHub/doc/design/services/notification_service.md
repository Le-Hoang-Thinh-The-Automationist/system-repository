Nice — now we’re at the **Notification & Communication Service**, which is the **cross-cutting service** in FSI: it touches **security, compliance, customer communication, and UX**. Let’s do the same as with the other services, but adapted to **Spring Boot**.

# 🔹 Technology Stack (Spring Boot + Cost-Optimized)

* **Backend Framework:** Spring Boot 3.x

  * `spring-boot-starter-web`
  * `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa`
  * `spring-boot-starter-security`
  * `spring-boot-starter-validation`
  * `spring-boot-starter-mail` (for email)

* **Notification Channels:**

  * **Email:** Spring Mail + SMTP (MailHog for dev, Mailgun free tier for prod MVP)
  * **In-app:** store in Postgres, query via API
  * **SMS:** Abstract with interface → Twilio/Nexmo SDK (can mock for MVP)
  * **Push Notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging (free tier)
  * **Webhooks:** simple HTTP POST via Spring `RestTemplate` or WebClient

* **Delivery Management:**

  * Retry queue: Spring Retry / Dead-letter queue (DB-backed for MVP)
  * Scheduling: `@Scheduled` or Spring Batch for recurring tasks
  * Preferences: stored per user in DB

* **Compliance & Audit:**

  * Audit trail: every notification stored in `delivery_logs`
  * No sensitive PII in messages → masked data only
  * Opt-in consent recorded in DB

* **Cost Optimization:**

  * Use free-tier email/SMS providers for MVP
  * In-app + webhook notifications free (DB + APIs)

# 🚀 MVP Scope (Spring Boot Notification Service)

1. **Send Notifications** (via API → email, in-app, webhook)
2. **User Preferences** (enable/disable notification types)
3. **Delivery Logs** (status, success/failure)
4. **Retry Failed Notifications** (basic retry with exponential backoff)
5. **In-app Notifications** (read/unread, history API)
6. **Triggers (MVP subset):**

   * Transaction created/updated
   * Large transaction alert (> \$500)
   * Security alert (new device login)
   * Monthly spending summary

# ⭐ Important Spring Boot–Specific Highlights

✅ **Spring Mail** → fast to implement for transactional emails.
✅ **Spring Retry + DB queue** → ensures delivery reliability without needing Kafka/RabbitMQ in MVP.
✅ **In-app notifications via DB** → simple, cheap, and auditable.
✅ **Audit logging** → every notification stored in `delivery_logs`.
✅ **Compliance** → strip sensitive data (e.g., “Your balance changed” not “Your balance is \$2,323.15”).
✅ **Modular Design** → each channel (email, SMS, push) can be a `@Service` implementing a `NotificationSender` interface.

---

# ✅ Acceptance Criteria (MVP, FSI-aligned)

### **Functional**

1. API can send notifications (`/notifications/send`).
2. User can configure preferences (`/notifications/preferences`).
3. Notifications triggered for: transaction created, large transaction, security alert, monthly summary.
4. In-app notifications stored and retrievable via API.
5. Delivery logs track success/failure for all messages.
6. Failed notifications retried automatically.
7. User can mark in-app notification as read.

### **Non-Functional**

1. All notifications encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3).
2. No sensitive PII included in notification content.
3. Communication history auditable in DB.
4. Opt-in consent stored for marketing/alerts.
5. Average notification delivery latency < 2s for email/in-app.
6. Service scales to handle at least 100 notifications/sec in MVP.
7. Deployment via Spring Boot + Postgres + Docker.

👉 Do you want me to also **propose a unified Notification DB schema** (notifications + delivery logs + preferences) like we did for Transactions/Analytics, so it’s concrete for a Spring Boot dev to follow?
