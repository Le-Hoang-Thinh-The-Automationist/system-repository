# Personal Financial Hub - Solo Developer Multi-Role Guide

## 🎭 Multi-Hat Approach Overview

As a **solo developer**, you'll rotate between three key roles throughout the project. This guide provides **realistic timelines** and **simplified approaches** that maintain professional standards while being achievable by one person.

### 🕐 Time Allocation Strategy
- **60% DevOps/Infrastructure** (Your primary growth area)
- **25% Backend Development** (Practical implementation)
- **15% Project Management** (Self-organization & tracking)

## 1. 🚀 DevOps Hat - SRE Metrics for Solo Developer

### 📊 Essential SRE Metrics (Simplified for Solo Management)

#### **Core Monitoring Dashboard (Single Pane of Glass)**
```yaml
Primary Metrics to Track:
├── Application Health: Up/Down status per service
├── Response Time: P95 latency < 500ms (relaxed for solo)
├── Error Rate: < 1% for critical paths
├── Resource Usage: CPU/Memory < 80%
└── Database Health: Connection count, query time
```

#### **Automated Alerting (Set & Forget)**
- **Critical Alerts** (Wake you up):
  - Service completely down
  - Database connection failures  
  - SSL certificate expiring < 7 days
  - Disk space > 90%
  
- **Warning Alerts** (Email/Slack):
  - Response time > 1 second
  - Error rate > 0.5%
  - CPU/Memory > 70%

#### **Financial Services Compliance (Minimum Viable)**
```yaml
Security Metrics:
├── SSL/TLS Grade: A rating (automated check)
├── Vulnerability Scan: Weekly automated scans
├── Backup Success: Daily automated verification
├── Uptime: Target 99% (allows 7.2 hours downtime/month)
└── Data Encryption: 100% (enforced by configuration)
```

### 🛠️ Solo-Friendly Infrastructure Design

#### **Phase 1: MVP Infrastructure (Month 1)**
```yaml
Simplified Stack:
├── Cloud: AWS Free Tier / DigitalOcean
├── Compute: 2-3 small instances (not full Kubernetes initially)
├── Database: Managed PostgreSQL (RDS/Managed DB)
├── Cache: Managed Redis (ElastiCache/managed)
├── Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana (pre-configured)
└── CI/CD: GitHub Actions (free tier)
```

#### **Phase 2: Scale Up (Month 3-4)**
```yaml
Enhanced Stack:
├── Container Orchestration: Docker Compose → ECS/GKE
├── Load Balancing: Application Load Balancer
├── Secrets: AWS Secrets Manager (simpler than Vault)
├── Logging: CloudWatch/DigitalOcean Logs
└── Backup: Automated daily snapshots
```

#### **Phase 3: Production Ready (Month 6)**
```yaml
Production Stack:
├── Multi-AZ: Primary + DR instance
├── Kubernetes: Managed EKS/GKE (avoid self-managed)
├── Security: AWS WAF, automated vulnerability scanning
├── Monitoring: Full observability stack
└── Compliance: Automated audit logging
```

### 📋 Solo DevOps Weekly Routine
```yaml
Monday (1 hour): Infrastructure health check
├── Review weekend alerts
├── Check resource utilization trends
├── Update dependency versions
└── Plan infrastructure improvements
