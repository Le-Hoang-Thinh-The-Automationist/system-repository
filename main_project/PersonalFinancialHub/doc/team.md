# 🕒 Weekly Time Schedule (Role Rotation)

### **Role Buckets**

* 🎯 **Product Owner / PM (Beginner)** → Planning, backlog grooming, writing docs, tracking progress.
* ⚙️ **DevOps (Primary, Senior-Level Learning)** → Infra, CI/CD, Kubernetes, monitoring.
* 💻 **Backend (Spring Boot, Secondary)** → Build functional services gradually.

---

## 📅 Weekday Evenings (1–2 hrs/day)

* **Monday – PM Mindset (Product Owner / PM Role)**

  * 30m: Review backlog, update Kanban/Trello/Jira board.
  * 30–60m: Write/refine requirements (Epics → Stories).
  * If time left: read tutorials/notes (research, not coding).
    👉 *Light task day — ease into week.*

* **Tuesday – DevOps (Hands-On)**

  * Terraform / infra IaC work.
  * Debugging CI/CD pipelines.
  * Small, contained technical tasks.
    👉 *Good day for steady progress on infrastructure.*

* **Wednesday – Backend (Coding Day)**

  * Implement a single backend feature (e.g., create user API).
  * Write unit tests for it.
    👉 *Keep backend bite-sized so it doesn’t overwhelm you.*

* **Thursday – DevOps (Deep Dive)**

  * Kubernetes deployment, Helm charts, monitoring setup.
  * Experiment with advanced features (Istio, Vault).
    👉 *Another technical day — focused on leveling up DevOps skills.*

* **Friday – PM & Cleanup (Review Role)**

  * Review what you achieved this week.
  * Update documentation (markdown/Confluence).
  * Move tasks on board.
    👉 *Wrap up the week like a real PM.*

## 📅 Weekend Day (Full 8–10 hrs)

Break into 3 “shifts” → so you rotate roles even in one day.

* **Morning (3–4 hrs): DevOps**

  * Longer deep work block → tackle bigger infra task (e.g., set up Grafana dashboards).

* **Afternoon (3 hrs): Backend**

  * Build/extend microservice (e.g., Transaction Service).
  * Test + integrate into pipeline.

* **Evening (2–3 hrs): PM / Review**

  * Sprint planning (decide what’s next week’s focus).
  * Update architecture diagram.
  * Reflect on blockers + risks.

# 📊 Suggested Monthly Rhythm

* **Month 1–2:** Focus 70% DevOps, 20% PM, 10% Backend → build infra foundation.
* **Month 3–4:** Balance 50% DevOps, 30% Backend, 20% PM → add services, refine CI/CD.
* **Month 5–6+:** Shift 40% DevOps, 40% Backend, 20% PM → evolve toward product MVP.

---

# ✅ Benefits of This Rotation

* You **train your brain to switch hats**: PM (planner/organizer), DevOps (infra builder), Backend (product creator).
* You avoid burnout — you’re not only doing Kubernetes every night.
* You get **incremental visible progress** each week → motivation stays high.
* By end of each week, you have both **documentation (PM side)** and **working infra/code (DevOps+BE side)**.

👉 Would you like me to **map this into a concrete 4-week “Sprint 0–1” plan** (with exact tasks per role per week) so you can literally start executing it like a real project?
