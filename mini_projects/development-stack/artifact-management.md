### Choosing the Right Tool
- **Artifactory** is best when you need a single, enterprise-grade manager for every artifact type plus container images, with ultra-scalable HA and deep CI/CD/DevSecOps integrations.  
- **Harbor** excels in Kubernetes-native environments that prioritize container security, compliance, and easy Helm/chart registry capabilities.  
- **Nexus Repository** shines for organizations seeking a cost-predictable, OSS-friendly universal manager with built-in supply-chain governance and edge-node flexibility.
